## Project 1

In this project, I have done the following:

<ol>
<li>Forked the repository at https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1</li>
<li>Created four scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot3.R) that read in previously downloaded
data, process it, and then create plots in PNG form.
</li>
<li>Uploaded the scripts and the PNG plots (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot2.png, plot4.png).</li>
</ol>

Each script contains more details in comment form.
